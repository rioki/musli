# musli

musli is a serialisation library that aims to be simple to use and put as little
burden on the client code as possible. Despite it's simplicity the design of
musli tries to serialize as many data setups as feasible. In addition to 
simplicity musli is designed to produce a compact binary format that is optimal
for quick loading and transport over a network.
